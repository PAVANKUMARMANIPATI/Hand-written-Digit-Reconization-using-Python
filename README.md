# Hand-written-Digit-Reconization-using-Python
Recognize handwritten digits with a CNN using the MNIST dataset, featuring a Tkinter GUI for image upload and prediction. Train the model using `mnist_cnn.py`, then utilize `mnist_gui.py` to interact with the trained model. GitHub includes `mnist.h5` for the model. Built with Python, Keras, TensorFlow, Tkinter, and Pillow.
